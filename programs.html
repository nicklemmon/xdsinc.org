					<p class="FullParagraph">The Farm at Penny Lane, located on 40 acres in northern Chatham County, uses a holistic and sustainable approach to enhance the quality of life of individuals with severe and persistent mental illness by offering opportunities to become healthier and more self-sufficient.</p>

					<p class="FullParagraph">Our major goals:</p>

					<p class="FullParagraph">
						<ul class="FullParagraph-unorderedList">
							<li class="FullParagraph-listItem">Maximize social, cognitive, physical, and psychological functioning of participants</li>
							<li class="FullParagraph-listItem">Enhance the general health and wellness of individuals</li>
							<li class="FullParagraph-listItem">Facilitate entrepreneurship for program participants</li>
							<li class="FullParagraph-listItem">Break down barriers in the community and reduce the stigma associated with mental illness</li>
							<li class="FullParagraph-listItem">The farm is in development and currently includes a community garden, a greenhouse, an apiary with nine beehives, a flock of heritage-breed chickens, and a walking trail.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h4>Community Garden</h4>

					<p class="FullParagraph">Staff and volunteers broke ground and planted a community garden in the fall of 2012. Bee hives, and a greenhouse have been added to the garden area. Chickens also arrived in the spring of 2014 and produce beautiful, brown eggs.</p>

					<p class="FullParagraph">Food from the garden is distributed to participants and others in the community.</p>



					<h4>Horticulture Therapy</h4>

					<p class="FullParagraph">The Community Garden is the center of a developing horticulture therapy program. A professional horticulture therapist from the North Carolina Botanical Gardens plans and conducts activity sessions to help participants achieve the following benefits:</p>

					<p class="FullParagraph">
						<ul class="FullParagraph-unorderedList">
							<li class="FullParagraph-listItem">Physical health through purposeful exercise (level determined by ability), fresh air, learning about nutrition, practicing healthy eating</li>
							<li class="FullParagraph-listItem">Emotional health through stress reduction, connecting to nature, creative expression, successful outcomes with plants</li>
							<li class="FullParagraph-listItem">Social health through social interaction, cooperative enterprise, community building</li>
							<li class="FullParagraph-listItem">Learning new skills in horticulture and related fields to promote vocational and leisure opportunities</li>
							<li class="FullParagraph-listItem">Participants in the program learn about gardening, nutrition, and how to prepare healthy food. Gardening also provides the opportunity for socializing and exercising.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h4>Community Work Days</h4>

					<p class="FullParagraph">Weekly and monthly work days serve three main purposes:</p>

					<p class="FullParagraph">
						<ul class="FullParagraph-orderedList">
							<li class="FullParagraph-listItem">Community-building – Everyone who comes out to help is considered a volunteer. There is no distinction made between staff, program participants, or community volunteers.</li>
							<li class="FullParagraph-listItem">Sustainability – With nearly an acre in production, a flock of chickens, a greenhouse, an apiary, and walking trail it takes the efforts of many to keep things running smoothly.</li>
							<li class="FullParagraph-listItem">Education – Besides learning about the unique opportunities provided at the farm, individuals can learn about sustainable agriculture, taking away skills they can use in their own gardens.</li>
						</ul>

				<div class="u-twoThirds">
					<p class="FullParagraph">Homelessness exacerbates illness, and creates a psychological environment in which recovery, in
					any form, is next to impossible.</p>

					<p class="FullParagraph">Which is why, at Penny Lane, we view housing as healthcare.</p>

					<p class="FullParagraph">Our vision at the Farm is to assist individuals living with mental health challenges to find a way	to become self-sufficient and have an improved quality of life. One of the ways we can do that is	to offer a housing solution that is affordable, energy efficient, and located in a supportive	community environment. A tiny home community on the Penny Lane campus offers a practical solution to the life of chronic homelessness and isolation experienced by many individuals with	mental illness.</p>

					<h4>What is a tiny home?</h4>

					<p class="FullParagraph">Tiny homes do not exceed 500 square feet. They are far less expensive than traditional homes in terms of taxes, building, heating, maintenance, and repair costs. Living in a tiny home also encourages a less cluttered and simpler lifestyle and minimizes ecological impacts.</p>
