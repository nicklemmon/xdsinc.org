#NOTES for NC Mental Health System Overview (name needs some work...)

---

##Objective
I want to make a website which provides mental health consumers (both families and prospective patients) with an effective overview of the mental health system. This would not only give an overview of the policies and systems at play, but give people a quick means by which to connect with a local MCO.
