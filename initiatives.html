				<div class="u-twoThirds">
					<p class="FullParagraph">Homelessness exacerbates illness, and creates a psychological environment in which recovery, in
					any form, is next to impossible.</p>

					<p class="FullParagraph">Which is why, at Penny Lane, we view housing as healthcare.</p>

					<p class="FullParagraph">Our vision at the Farm is to assist individuals living with mental health challenges to find a way	to become self-sufficient and have an improved quality of life. One of the ways we can do that is	to offer a housing solution that is affordable, energy efficient, and located in a supportive	community environment. A tiny home community on the Penny Lane campus offers a practical solution to the life of chronic homelessness and isolation experienced by many individuals with	mental illness.</p>

					<h4>What is a tiny home?</h4>

					<p class="FullParagraph">Tiny homes do not exceed 500 square feet. They are far less expensive than traditional homes in terms of taxes, building, heating, maintenance, and repair costs. Living in a tiny home also encourages a less cluttered and simpler lifestyle and minimizes ecological impacts.</p>

					<p class="FullParagraph">A collaboration between UNC Center for Excellence in Community Mental Health and paws4people foundation, the Shelter to Pet program trains individuals with mental illness to teach rescued dogs obedience command so that forever homes in the community may be found.</p>

					<h4> Personal support dogs at Penny lane</h4>

					<p class="FullParagraph">A personal support dog (also known as an emotional support animal) provides therapeutic support to clients through companionship, affection, and promoting positive self-regard.  PSDâ€™S do not have public access, require yearly certification or perform specific tasks (typically, although some may be able to) as assistance dogs do.  However, personal support dogs are permitted in housing that otherwise does not allow dogs through the Fair Housing Act and on airlines in compliance with the Airline Carrier Access guidelines with proper documentation provided by licensed mental health professionals.</p>

					<p class="FullParagraph">For more information on our personal support dog program, please contact Sunny Westerman at <a href="mailto:sunny_westerman@med.unc.edu">sunny_westerman@med.unc.edu</a>.</p>
