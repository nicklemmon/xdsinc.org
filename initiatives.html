				<div class="u-twoThirds">
					<p class="FullParagraph">Homelessness exacerbates illness, and creates a psychological environment in which recovery, in
					any form, is next to impossible.</p>

					<p class="FullParagraph">Which is why, at Penny Lane, we view housing as healthcare.</p>

					<p class="FullParagraph">Our vision at the Farm is to assist individuals living with mental health challenges to find a way	to become self-sufficient and have an improved quality of life. One of the ways we can do that is	to offer a housing solution that is affordable, energy efficient, and located in a supportive	community environment. A tiny home community on the Penny Lane campus offers a practical solution to the life of chronic homelessness and isolation experienced by many individuals with	mental illness.</p>

					<h4>What is a tiny home?</h4>

					<p class="FullParagraph">Tiny homes do not exceed 500 square feet. They are far less expensive than traditional homes in terms of taxes, building, heating, maintenance, and repair costs. Living in a tiny home also encourages a less cluttered and simpler lifestyle and minimizes ecological impacts.</p>
